# AI-Powered-email-alert-via-telegram-bot
This project introduces an AI-integrated system that bridges the gap between traditional email communication and real-time messaging by delivering intelligent, real-time alerts via Telegram. It continuously monitors email accounts using IMAP polling every 60 seconds and uses AI techniques (TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity) to filter and prioritize emails based on user-defined keywords. If AI fails to match, the system falls back to exact keyword matching to ensure reliability.
The system supports two email accounts per user and stores credentials securely in SQLite using encryption. It logs email analytics like keyword matches, timestamps, and similarity scores in MongoDB for performance tracking and insights. Alerts are sent through a Telegram bot using MarkdownV2 formatting for readability.
A Flask-based web dashboard allows users to visualize email trends, matched keywords, and recent activity with secure bcrypt authentication. The system is built with Python and uses a threaded architecture for scalability and fast response. It aims to reduce information overload by automating the detection of important emails and enhancing productivity.
